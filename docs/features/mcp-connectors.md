# MCP Connectors

MCP connectors let **external AI clients drive this Instatic instance** over the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Instatic acts as an **MCP server**: a local client (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) or a remote agent connects, lists the available tools, and operates the CMS — reading the site, editing page structure, and managing content — exactly the way the built-in AI panel does.

This is the mirror image of the **Providers** tab (`server/ai/credentials/`), which points Instatic's *own* agent outward at LLM providers. MCP connectors point inward: they let outside agents reach in.

The server is implemented with the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. That package is banned everywhere else in the tree (the AI drivers hand-roll provider REST); it is allowed **only under `server/ai/mcp/`**, scoped by `ai-driver-isolation.test.ts`.

---

## TL;DR

- **Instatic is an MCP server.** One Streamable-HTTP endpoint at `/_instatic/mcp` serves both local and remote clients (local is just `localhost`).
- **Thin adapter over the existing tool engine.** No tool logic is duplicated. MCP is a new *caller* alongside the built-in agent and the plugin host; tool dispatch reuses `executeAiTool`.
- **Tool surface = the full catalog.** Server-resolved tools (content reads + `site_read_styles`) run headless — no editor needed. Every browser-execution tool the agent panel has (structure edits, insert HTML, apply CSS, assign classes, set design tokens, manage pages, content CRUD, code assets, live-DOM reads) is exposed too, **relayed to an open editor via the live editor bridge** — the single source of truth for page editing. If the connector owner has no editor open, those tools return a clear "open the editor" error; the headless reads still work.
- **Bearer-token auth, one secret per connector.** The token is shown once on creation and stored only as a SHA-256 hash. New tokens expire after 90 days by default; admins can choose a custom TTL or explicitly create a non-expiring token. Revocable.
- **Capability-gated.** A connector carries a granted capability subset; the same gate the built-in agent uses (`toolAllowedForCapabilities`) filters the toolset. An MCP caller can never invoke a tool the granting capabilities couldn't authorize over HTTP.
- **Privilege floor.** An admin can only grant capabilities they themselves hold.
- **Managed from the admin UI:** AI workspace → **MCP** tab.

        │

        │
server/ai/mcp/auth.ts                 Bearer token → connector → capability set (401 + WWW-Authenticate otherwise)
        │

### Module layout — `server/ai/mcp/`

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `transports/http.ts` | Mounts the SDK's Web-standard Streamable-HTTP transport; stateless per request (`enableJsonResponse`). |
| `auth.ts` | Bearer resolution → `{ connectorId, userId, capabilities }`; spec-correct 401 with an RFC 9728 `resource_metadata` pointer. |
| `server.ts` | Builds a capability-scoped low-level `Server` (`ListTools` / `CallTool` handlers). Uses the low-level `Server`, not `McpServer.registerTool`, because the latter needs Zod (banned) — this lets the TypeBox `inputSchema` pass through verbatim. |
| `registry.ts` | The exposable toolset = full catalog (content + site + page-tree), deduped by name, filtered by `toolAllowedForCapabilities`. |
| `tools/styleTools.ts` | `site_read_styles` — the design system as a CSS stylesheet, headless from the DB. |
| `editorBridge.ts` | Per-user live editor bridge registry + `createEditorBridgeStream`; `getEditorBridgeForUser` routes browser tools to the owner's open editor. |
| `handlers/editorBridge.ts` | `GET /admin/api/ai/editor-bridge` — the NDJSON stream the editor holds open. |
| `connectors/` | `types.ts` (server-only record), `token.ts` (generate + SHA-256 hash), `store.ts` (CRUD + `toConnectorView`). |
| `handlers/connectors.ts` | `/admin/api/ai/mcp/connectors` CRUD, gated by `ai.providers.manage`. |

The headless page-tree path (load → `applyTreeOperation` → persist) lives in `server/ai/content/treeService.ts` and is shared with the plugin RPC `cms.content.tree.mutate` — neither caller duplicates the engine. Gated by `plugin-content-tree-via-engine.test.ts`.

## Tool surface

MCP exposes the **full tool catalog** (deduped by name), capability-filtered. Tools fall in two execution classes:

**Single source of truth.** All page *editing* goes through the **live editor store** (browser tools, relayed to the open editor). There is deliberately **no** headless DB-mutating page-tree tool: an earlier `read_page_tree`/`mutate_page_tree` pair edited the DB directly, creating a second copy of each page with identical node ids that desynced from the open editor and got clobbered by its autosave (data loss). They were removed — structure editing uses the editor's browser tools, which the existing save-flush persists.

**Headless (server-resolved) — work with no editor open:**
- Content reads — list/read collections, entries, data rows, media.
- `get_context({ entryId? })` — orientation in one call: is a live editor connected (browser tools need it), which "everywhere"/post-type templates wrap pages, site name. Call it first if a browser tool returns "open the editor."
- `site_read_styles({ format?, className?, includeTokens? })` — the design system as a **CSS stylesheet**: design tokens (CSS custom properties) + every class/ambient rule, read straight from the DB via the publisher's emitters. `format:"summary"` returns a compact class catalog (selector + referenced token vars, no declarations) to scan first. Symmetric with reading pages as HTML / writing CSS via `site_apply_css`. Replaces the old snapshot-dependent `list_tokens`.
- `site_list_breakpoints` — configured viewport ids/labels/widths (the first is the base), so `site_render_snapshot` can target one deliberately. Headless version replaces the snapshot-dependent one.

**Browser-relayed (via the live editor bridge) — require an open editor:**
- Structure editing — `site_insert_html`, `site_replace_node_html`, `site_delete_node`, `site_move_node`, `site_duplicate_node`, `site_rename_node`, `site_update_node_props`.
- HTML/CSS authoring (`site_apply_css`, `site_assign_class`, `site_remove_class`), page lifecycle (`site_add_page`, …), design tokens (`site_set_color_tokens`, …), content CRUD (`content_create_document`, `content_set_document_field`, …), code assets, structure reads (`site_read_document`), and live-DOM reads (`site_render_snapshot`, `site_get_node_html`).
- These have no server implementation — their logic runs in the editor app against the live store. The MCP server relays the call to the connector owner's open editor and awaits the result (see "Live editor bridge"); image attachments (e.g. `site_render_snapshot`'s PNG) come back as MCP image content blocks. No editor connected → a clear error asking the operator to open it.

## Live editor bridge

`server/ai/mcp/editorBridge.ts` keeps one bridge per user (newest open editor wins), keyed by `userId` so a connector can only reach **its own owner's** editor.

```
MCP browser-tool call            Editor (open in a browser)
   │ executeAiTool(browser)         │ useEditorMcpBridge() holds the stream open
   ▼                                ▼
buildMcpServer → getEditorBridgeForUser(userId)
   │ bridge.callBrowser(tool, input) → emits toolRequest ─────────────▶ executeAgentTool(tool, input)
   │                                                                        │ (live store)
   ◀───────────── POST /admin/api/ai/tool-result ◀── postToolResult ◀───────┘
```

- Editor side: `useEditorMcpBridge` (mounted in `SitePage`) opens `GET /admin/api/ai/editor-bridge` (NDJSON, admin-session auth), runs each `toolRequest` through the SAME `executeAgentTool` the agent panel uses, and POSTs the result back. Reconnects with backoff. After a tool that leaves unsaved changes, it **flushes the draft save** (`flushEditorSave`) so a follow-up headless read (`site_read_styles` / content reads) sees the change immediately instead of waiting for the 30 s autosave.
- Server side: reuses the chat bridge machinery wholesale — `createBridge` issues the `AiBrowserBridge`, `resolveBridgeToolResult` settles it from the existing `/admin/api/ai/tool-result` endpoint.

This is why an open editor (yours, or one the agent opens) unlocks the full editing surface without reimplementing any tool.

## Authentication

Each connector has a bearer secret (`imcp_…`). The client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The server hashes the presented token and looks up a non-revoked, non-expired connector, yielding its capability set. Missing/invalid/expired tokens get a `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"`.

Works today with Claude Code, Cursor, Claude.ai custom connectors, and custom remote agents.

Managed connector UIs that require an OAuth flow are not compatible with the current bearer-token implementation.

---

## Connecting a client

Create a connector in **AI → MCP**, choose its type and capabilities, then copy the token (shown once).

**Local (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor):**

```sh
claude mcp add instatic --transport http http://localhost:3000/_instatic/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer imcp_…"
```

**Remote:** point the client at `https://<your-host>/_instatic/mcp` and send the token as an `Authorization: Bearer` header.

## Data model

`ai_mcp_connectors` (migration `018` plus additive expiry migration `019`, PG + SQLite parity):

| column | notes |
|---|---|
| `id`, `user_id`, `label` | owner + display name |
| `type` | `local` \| `remote` |
| `auth_mode` | `bearer` for every connector created by the current UI/API. The schema also accepts `oauth` as a reserved storage value, but no OAuth flow creates or authenticates those rows today. |
| `token_hash` | SHA-256 of the secret; never the plaintext. Unique. |
| `capabilities_json` | granted capability subset |
| `created_at`, `last_used_at`, `revoked_at` | lifecycle; revoked tokens fail auth |
| `expires_at` | token expiry; new tokens default to 90 days, `NULL` means explicitly non-expiring or grandfathered |

The wire-safe `McpConnectorView` (the only HTTP-returned shape) includes `expiresAt` but never includes the hash — gated by `ai-mcp-connectors-never-leak.test.ts`. Create and revoke are audited (`ai.mcp_connector.created` / `ai.mcp_connector.revoked`).

---

## Capabilities

Connector management is gated by `ai.providers.manage` (the AI-integrations admin surface). A connector's granted capabilities flow straight into the existing tool gate:

- mutating tools require `ai.tools.write`;
- page-tree edits require any of `site.structure.edit` / `site.content.edit` / `site.style.edit` / `pages.edit`;
- reads require any site/content read grant.

An admin cannot grant a capability they do not hold (enforced in `handlers/connectors.ts`).

## Tests

- `server/ai/mcp/connectors/{token,store}.test.ts` — token hashing, expiry, and store CRUD.
- `server/ai/content/treeService.test.ts` — headless load/mutate/persist.
- `server/ai/mcp/{registry,auth,server,transports/http}.test.ts` — capability filtering, bearer auth + 401, full MCP round-trip (list/read/mutate), HTTP handshake.
- `src/__tests__/ai/mcpConnectorsHandler.test.ts` — CRUD, privilege floor, capability gating.
- `src/__tests__/architecture/ai-mcp-connectors-never-leak.test.ts` — token never serialized.
