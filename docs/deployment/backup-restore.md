# Backup And Restore

A complete backup includes the database and the uploaded media. The procedure depends on whether you're using Postgres or SQLite as the database engine. Pick the matching section below.

---

## TL;DR

| Deployment | Database backup | Upload backup |
|---|---|---|
| VPS SQLite Compose | Copy `/app/data/cms.db` from the `data` volume | Archive the `uploads` volume |
| VPS Postgres Compose | `pg_dump` from the `postgres` service | Archive the `uploads` volume |
| Railway SQLite | Back up the app volume mounted at `/app/storage` | Same app volume, under `/app/storage/uploads` |
| Railway Postgres | Back up the Postgres service volume/database | Back up the app volume mounted at `/app/storage` |

## Postgres mode — backup

Create a local backup directory:

```sh
mkdir -p backups
```

Load environment values from `.env`:

```sh
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
```

Dump Postgres:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" "$POSTGRES_DB" \
  > "backups/instatic-$(date +%F).sql"
```

Archive uploads:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v instatic-prod_uploads:/uploads:ro \
  -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" \
  alpine \
  tar czf "/backup/instatic-uploads-$(date +%F).tgz" -C /uploads .
```

If your Compose project name is not `instatic-prod`, find the actual uploads volume name with `docker volume ls | grep uploads`.

## Postgres mode — restore

Start Postgres before restoring:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml up -d postgres
```

Restore the database:

```sh
set -a
. ./.env
set +a

cat backups/instatic-YYYY-MM-DD.sql | docker compose -f compose.prod.yml exec -T postgres \
  psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" "$POSTGRES_DB"
```

Restore uploads:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v instatic-prod_uploads:/uploads \
  -v "$PWD/backups:/backup" \
  alpine \
  sh -lc "rm -rf /uploads/* && tar xzf /backup/instatic-uploads-YYYY-MM-DD.tgz -C /uploads"
```

Then start the full stack:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## SQLite mode — backup

The `compose.sqlite.yml` override stores the SQLite database in the `data` named volume at `/app/data/cms.db`. Both ad-hoc and continuous strategies are documented below.

### Ad-hoc snapshot (transactional, safe while the app is running)

Use Bun (already in the app container) and SQLite's online backup API to capture a consistent snapshot without stopping the CMS:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml exec app \
  bun -e "import { Database } from 'bun:sqlite'; const src = new Database('/app/data/cms.db', { readonly: true }); src.exec(\"VACUUM INTO '/app/data/snapshot.db'\");"

docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml cp \
  app:/app/data/snapshot.db "./backups/instatic-$(date +%F).db"

docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml exec app \
  rm /app/data/snapshot.db
```

`VACUUM INTO` writes a fully consistent copy of the database to a new file — safe to run live, no locking required. Then `docker compose cp` exports it to the host.

Archive uploads exactly the same way as the Postgres mode (the `uploads` volume is shared between the two modes).

### Continuous replication with Litestream (recommended for production)

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) replicates a SQLite database to S3-compatible object storage with second-level RPO. Add a sidecar to the SQLite stack:

```yaml
# Append to compose.sqlite.yml under `services:`
  litestream:
    image: litestream/litestream:latest
    command: replicate
    volumes:
      - data:/data:ro
      - ./litestream.yml:/etc/litestream.yml:ro
    environment:
      LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID:?Set S3 access key in .env}
      LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:?Set S3 secret key in .env}
    depends_on:
      - app
    restart: unless-stopped
```

`litestream.yml`:

```yaml
dbs:
  - path: /data/cms.db
    replicas:
      - type: s3
        bucket: my-cms-backups
        path: cms.db
        region: us-east-1
```

With Litestream running, every write to `cms.db` is shipped to S3 within seconds. To restore, point Litestream at the S3 backup before starting the app:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v instatic-prod_data:/data \
  -e LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  -v "$PWD/litestream.yml:/etc/litestream.yml:ro" \
  litestream/litestream:latest \
  restore -o /data/cms.db /data/cms.db

docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml up -d
```

## SQLite mode — restore (ad-hoc snapshots)

If you took a `VACUUM INTO` snapshot rather than running Litestream:

```sh
# Stop the app first — restoring overwrites the live DB.
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml stop app

# Copy the backup file into the data volume (replacing the existing DB).
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml run --rm --no-deps \
  --entrypoint "" app sh -lc "rm -f /app/data/cms.db /app/data/cms.db-wal /app/data/cms.db-shm"

docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml cp \
  "./backups/instatic-YYYY-MM-DD.db" app:/app/data/cms.db

# Start the app — the WAL/SHM sidecar files will be regenerated on next open.
docker compose -f compose.prod.yml -f compose.sqlite.yml up -d
```

Restore uploads exactly as in Postgres mode.

## Hosted Provider Backups

When Instatic runs on a provider that offers managed Postgres (Railway Postgres, RDS, Supabase, Render Postgres, Fly Postgres, etc.), the provider's snapshot, volume backup, or point-in-time tooling is the recommended first backup path. Keep an independent `pg_dump` schedule when you need provider-independent recovery.

Railway-specific paths:

| Template | Database path | Upload path |
|---|---|---|
| SQLite | `/app/storage/data/cms.db` | `/app/storage/uploads` |
| Postgres | Railway Postgres service | `/app/storage/uploads` |

For uploads, back up whatever disk or volume is mounted at `UPLOADS_DIR`.
